## Developer section

### Help

If you want to help making the Website you are welcome to do that!
Simply pull the code, add your changes and make Pull request.

### API

there is an API on /api with an OpenAPI spec on /.
You will need an API-Key findable in the settings Menu when logged in.

The Website will make requests that are not on the public API using an internal api on /internal. I do not recommend to use as it uses your session to authenticate which is unreliable when not used in the Browser. If you want to make API requests that aren’t supported yet:
- Ask me (easy)
- Make a new issue on GitHub (medium)
- Add it yourself and make a pull request. (expert)

### javascript

The JavaScript on the site is minified to optimize speed using terser but the source maps are available at filepath/filename.js.map

### TODO

- website redesign
- Add more Sections:
  - Tierlists
  - Voting
- add memes to posts
