## Developer section

### API

there is an API on /api with an OpenAPI spec on /. You can use that API to automate tasks or build Widgets or smth. You will need an API-Key findable in the settings Menue when logged in.

The Website will make requests that are not on the public API using an internal api on /internal. I do not recoment to use as it used your session to authenticate which is unreliable. If you want to make API requests that aren’t supported yet:

- Ask me (easy)
- Make a new issue on GitHub (medium)
- Add it yourself and make a pull request. (expert)

### javascript

The JavaScript on the site is minified to optimize speed using terser but the source maps are available at filepath/filename.js.map

### TODO

- website redesign
- Add more Sections:
  - Tierlists
  - Voting
- add memes to posts
